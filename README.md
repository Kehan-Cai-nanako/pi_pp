# pi_pp
A python script to postprocess Path Integral MD trajectory generated by LAMMPS.

A typical workflow consists of 3 steps:
1. Run `srun -n NBEAD python xyz2npy.py` to read the LAMMPS trajectory files and save them as `npy`.
2. Run `srun -n NBEAD python fnm2f.py` to transform Cartesian force into normal mode forces.
3. Run `srun -n NBEAD python ke_estimator.py` to calculate the kinetic energy estimators.
